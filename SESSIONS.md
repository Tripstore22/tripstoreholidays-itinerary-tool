# Session Handoff

## Latest Session — 2026-05-07 (Brief 4: Sheet ID + deployment hygiene + LIVE API_URL leak fix)

### Completed
- Audit phase: `AUDIT_2026-05-07.md`, `RECONCILE_2026-05-07.md`, `CLEANUP_2026-05-07.md`. Bucket A=0 (LIVE app→DEV Sheet violations); Bucket F=0 (no 5th Sheet ID).
- Repointed 8 Python files off `_OLD` Sheet (`1cdI1Gz…`): `cross_reference.py` + `build_city_intelligence.py` → LIVE; `test_intelligence.py` + 5 dev-appscript scripts → DEV. Deleted duplicate `dev-appscript/build_city_intelligence.py`.
- Cosmetic: HTML header comments + CLAUDE.md DEV Sheet ID + CLAUDE.md DEV deploy ID corrected to current values.
- **LIVE HTML API_URL leak closed.** Initial promote (`b72e2d1`, 16:35 IST) hit `promote_to_live.sh` URL-detection bug — silent no-op. Fix-forward via direct sed in `8dd7e34` (17:43 IST) corrected `index.html` + `index_fit.tripstore.html` L1471 to `LIVE_DEPLOY_ID` (`AKfycbwP9KQH…`).
- clasp-live deployments: main @78, BF @79 ("promote 2026-05-07_1635"). `ItineraryEngine.gs` gained `_v31DayClusters` from prior DEV work.
- Verified: `smoketest_2026_05_07_brief4` signup at 17:43:30 → row landed in LIVE Users (17 rows), absent from DEV Users (16 rows). Leak closed end-to-end.
- TRUTH.md UNRESOLVED BLOCKER row 5 (Sightseeing tab split) silently resolved already — LIVE's `Sightseeing` tab is now the canonical 15-col 1655-row tab; `Sightseeing_v2` no longer exists on LIVE.

### Discoveries / lessons
- **`promote_to_live.sh` URL-detection heuristic is broken** (lines 113–128). Grep stops at `.` so HTML comment ellipsis like `prev pinned @5 AKfycbwRr9k5...)` yields a truncated 12-char fragment that may sort alphabetically before the real URL → sed swap silently no-ops. Fix sketch: anchor regex to `macros/s/AKfycb[A-Za-z0-9_-]+/exec`. Until fixed, every promote risks the same silent leak.
- **Pipeline.gs in `~/Desktop/Itinerary-Create/` is part of the pre-push validation chain** (read by `check_pipeline.py` GUARD 6). 4 orphan `.gs` files + 2 validators in that folder are pre-clasp-split mirrors — cleanup deferred to a session that audits all 6 together.
- Bucket A=0 confirms `clasp-live/Code.gs` already complies with Rule 2; `_pipeline_map.md` rumour about DEV-Sheet reads in v3 functions was out of date. `DEV_SHEET_ID` constant at L1745 is dead code.

### Still pending
- **Sumit-manual:** delete `smoketest_2026_05_07_brief4` row from LIVE Users; revoke service-account write access on `_OLD` Sheet (`1cdI1Gz…`); confirm Drive rename `Itinerary Builder_Master [DEV]_OLD_ARCHIVED_2026_05_07_DO_NOT_USE`.
- **High-priority:** patch `promote_to_live.sh` URL-regex (otherwise next promote can re-introduce leak). Add unit test for truncated-comment-fragment case.
- **Orphan cleanup session:** decide delete-vs-update for `Itinerary-Create/{Pipeline,Automation,Code,Quote_Intelligence}.gs` + `check_pipeline.py` + `check_html.py`.
- (Carryover) Brief 2F v3.1 BETA promote to LIVE — DEV @30 ready.
- (Carryover) Visual confirmation on LIVE: Brief D3 cream panel + AGENT logo fallback.
- (Carryover) Coverage Dashboard real content; tag taxonomy v2 cleanup; PDF/Excel intelligence merge.

---

## Session — 2026-05-04 (5-role RBAC system shipped to DEV)

### 04 May 2026 — RBAC: ADMIN / INTERNAL / AGENT / MANAGER / DATA_MANAGER live on DEV
- 12 existing users migrated to new role taxonomy via one-shot `migrateRoles()` in Code.gs (since deleted). Activated 2 PENDING accounts: vinay.vishwanath → AGENT, mgrad → MANAGER.
- Backend: `getQuoteLog()` + `getSavedList()` rewritten with 5-role filter — ADMIN/INTERNAL/MANAGER see all rows authored by internal-type users; AGENT/DATA_MANAGER see own only. New `getAllUsers(role)` for Manager View (ADMIN+MANAGER only). All in `clasp-dev/Code.gs`.
- Frontend: `applyRoleVisibility(role)` added as single source of truth for nav visibility. Replaces legacy `.admin-only-tab` / `.user-only-tab` dual-class scheme. New nav buttons + tab containers for Coverage Dashboard (placeholder) and Manager View (live, fetches `getAllUsers`, renders user table).
- `checkAutoLogin` widened from hardcoded `ADMIN`/`USER` to all 5 roles + safe fallback. Branding gate switched from `!isAdmin` → `currentRole === 'AGENT'`.
- DEV deployment cut: **@18** = `AKfycbxrC4tULOlFLPvTIDt8HpJtmsiuueF2gurUxaoaiHQzns_fxeLyMoKP2WZrt6OhalWkPQ`. HTML `API_URL` switched from prior pinned `AKfycbwRr9k5...` (@5).
- Verified end-to-end via local `python3 -m http.server 8080`: admin (8 nav items), bensonjoseph/MANAGER (5), shreyanka/AGENT (3 + profile), tabassum/DATA_MANAGER (4 incl. coverage). Manager View renders all 12 users with role badges + per-user quote counts.
- `agent_id == username` confirmed as canonical (no separate Agent_ID column). All RBAC code keys on lowercased username.
- "Internal-type users" defined as `{ADMIN, INTERNAL, MANAGER}` for `getQuoteLog`/`getSavedList` visibility — chose to include ADMIN over the brief's literal "INTERNAL/MANAGER user" wording.
- **Trap discovered:** documented "DEV @HEAD URL" `AKfycbzFTBGVeZ6oQglrgULFCJ1ESHqxipL-QGCHLVL9hBk8` requires Google sign-in — fine in editor, but browser `fetch()` from localhost gets bounced to `accounts.google.com`. Pinned "Anyone"-access deployments are mandatory for DEV testing. `.deployment_ids` comment ("DEV is @HEAD only") needs revision.
- **Sheet hygiene:** role values must use UNDERSCORE (`DATA_MANAGER`, not `DATA MANAGER`). One row was set with a space and silently fell through to safe-default visibility. Fixed in sheet; deliberately did NOT add code-side normalization (would mask future drift).

### Still pending
- Coverage Dashboard real content — clone from `~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/coverage_dashboard.html` into existing `tab-coverage` stub. Deferred to next session.
- LIVE promote of RBAC — currently DEV-only. Needs separate decision call; LIVE still on old binary ADMIN/USER model.
- (Carryover) Sightseeing tab migration; tag taxonomy v2 cleanup; PDF/Excel intelligence merge — none touched today.

## Session — 2026-04-28 → 29 (Whitelist v2 LIVE shipped + deploy-pipeline bug fixed)

> **Resume here.** Customer URL serves **67 launch cities** (66 + Madeira). LIVE Code.gs is on the new pivot schema, Sheet's `Launch_Cities_Whitelist` is the 13-col pivot layout, conditional formatting in place. `promote_to_live.sh` permanently patched to do `clasp deploy --deploymentId` (not just `clasp push`). DECISIONS.md says Sightseeing migration is now the next priority. TRUTH.md and DECISIONS.md at `~/Desktop/TripStore/`.

### Completed
- **Whitelist v2 LIVE shipped (2026-04-29 13:48 IST)** — atomic flip + push + deploy executed clean. Endpoint verifies 67 cities incl. Madeira. LIVE deployment bumped @45 → @46.
- **Discovered + fixed deploy-pipeline bug.** `clasp push` only updates HEAD; the customer URL `AKfycbwP9KQH…/exec` is pinned to a versioned deployment and keeps serving its pinned version forever without `clasp deploy --deploymentId`. UI-bound `onOpen` menus DO use HEAD (that's the trap — DEV testing "works" while production silently no-ops). Caused a 5-minute outage on 2026-04-28 ~20:30 (rolled back cleanly).
- **`promote_to_live.sh` patched** to call `clasp deploy --deploymentId` after `clasp push`. Reads ID from `~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/.deployment_ids` (gitignored). Aborts loud if missing.
- **Captured deployment IDs:** `LIVE_DEPLOY_ID=AKfycbwP9KQH…` (was @45, now @46), `DEV_DEPLOY_ID=AKfycbzFTBGVeZ6oQglrgULFCJ1ESHqxipL-QGCHLVL9hBk8` (DEV is @HEAD-only, push alone updates web app).
- **Whitelist v2 DEV-side (2026-04-28):** built `build_whitelist_seed_v2.py` (228 cities, 13-col pivot, 67 Live=Y after Madeira), `push_whitelist_seed_v2.py` (DEV write + 9 conditional formatting rules), added `refreshWhitelistStatus` + helpers + `onOpen` menu to clasp-dev/Code.gs, fixed `getLaunchCities` to read col 3.
- **Structural cleanups (2026-04-28):** renamed clasp-dev `.js` → `.gs` and narrowed `scriptExtensions` to `[".gs"]`; created `THIS_IS_DEV.md` / `THIS_IS_PRODUCTION.md` markers; moved DEV HTML to `~/Desktop/Itinerary-Create/dev/index_fit.tripstore.DEV.html`; updated CLAUDE.md, SESSIONS.md, settings.local.json paths.
- **DEV scriptId corrected:** clasp-dev was bound to orphan `1BP-Zh79…` for unknown duration. Real DEV container-bound script is `1Mr-dMvu1roz7zxh3tukTgW3SxOJQYzYJ_X43k8uRXMJ2etfLj5lZ-f_k`. Discovered when DEV menu wouldn't load after a `clasp push`.
- **DEV Sheet ID confirmed:** `1iENrNwWTtU9O664hXYS8dBG1rbcHr2x9Xt294UeORM4` (NOT `1cdI1Gz…` as CLAUDE.md still says — see "Stale CLAUDE.md" below).
- **GitHub PAT rotated:** old `ghp_Pg7F…` removed from `Itinerary-Create/.git/config`; osxkeychain configured.
- **`revertEmptyPriceHotels()` + `markDuplicateInputHotels()` written + deployed** to both DEV and LIVE Temp.gs (LIVE original markDuplicateInputHotels preserved; new functions appended). Awaiting first manual run from Apps Script editor.

### Still pending
- **Sightseeing tab migration** — `Pipeline.gs:45` writes to old `Sightseeing` tab while engine reads `Sightseeing_v2`. Per DECISIONS.md rule 4, this is now the next priority.
- **Frontend cache rewrite** (network-first `fetchLaunchCities`) — deferred. Customers with cached localStorage need hard refresh to see Madeira/Levi until rewrite ships.
- **Apps Script `resetErrorRows()`** — 25 ERROR Hotels + 19 ERROR Trains queued; user-manual run from script editor.
- **Anthropic API key rotation** — longstanding blocker, still unconfirmed.
- **Cleanup nice-to-have:** orphan DEV script `1BP-Zh79…` and 7 of 9 LIVE deployments can be deleted.

### Stale CLAUDE.md (worth fixing in a future session, not this one)
- CLAUDE.md says **DEV Sheet** is `1cdI1Gz652pTyqX5gVIJ6AHssMZiHD0VLr_KJXt0hETE`. Actual is `1iENrNwWTtU9O664hXYS8dBG1rbcHr2x9Xt294UeORM4` (per DECISIONS.md and `clasp-dev/THIS_IS_DEV.md`).
- CLAUDE.md says LIVE URL contains `AKfycbzAbIgzRoN_MNs377jm3u`. That's actually deployment @42 ("BF Added"). Active LIVE customer URL is `AKfycbwP9KQH…` (@46 as of today).
- CLAUDE.md says clasp-dev uses `.js` — true until 2026-04-28; we standardised to `.gs` everywhere now.

### Key learnings (memory-pinned)
- **`clasp push` ≠ "production updated."** Always pair with `clasp deploy --deploymentId` for any change touching the web-app endpoint. UI-bound `onOpen` menus use HEAD, that's the misleading bit. Captured in `reference_clasp_deploy_workflow.md`.
- **Verify brief premises:** today's brief had wrong credential paths, wrong API URL, and proposed using `promote_to_live.sh` despite known DEV HTML drift. Pre-flight checks caught all three.
- **Atomic schema flips:** when a sheet schema and its reader code change together, do them back-to-back. Window between is protected by frontend fallback (40 hardcoded cities).

## Session — 2026-04-26 → 27 (Viator v2 diagnostics — paused for strategic call)

> Read `~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/VIATOR_V2_DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT.md` first (TL;DR + γ/β/∅ paths). Sumit's strategic call (γ vs β vs ∅) is the only blocker on Viator v2 implementation. All diagnostic artifacts saved to `~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/probe5/` and `~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/probe5_us/`.



### Completed
- **v1 Viator enrichment shipped** (yesterday's work continued): full overnight run of `viator_enrich.py` on 1,732 master rows finished at 08:03 IST, **1,202 MATCH (69.3%) / 351 PARTIAL / 157 NO_RESULT, 0 timeouts**. Output at `~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/outputs/Viator_Enrichment.csv` (4,800 data rows + header) and `.xlsx`.
- **v1 audit harness built and run** (`viator_audit.py audit_20.csv`): originally returned 20/20 BLOCKED because Viator's Akamai blocks `chromium-headless-shell`. Patched to use `channel='chrome'` (real Chrome, headless) — 20/20 pages loaded, 10/20 OK / 10/20 WRONG_PRICE. Diagnosis: every WRONG_PRICE row has `title_match=1.0` (right product) but the audit's greedy `parse_inr` picks up sidebar add-on/decoy prices (₹303, ₹651) as "Min_Price_On_Page", inflating the diff vs scraped price. **Scraper is correct on titles; audit script's price extraction is too greedy.** Documented in chat — three improvement options (DOM-scoped extraction / "any tier within 5%" match / filter low-price add-ons).
- **Viator v2 brief landed** (`~/Downloads/CLAUDE_CODE_BRIEF_viator_v2.md`, updated v2). Brief specifies page-render via Playwright real Chrome (lessons from v1 baked in), per-option-tile capture, `private_*` / `per_group_flat` / `shared_per_person` pricing models, match scoring, streaming output, resume-by-URL.
- **`viator_enrich_v2.py` staged** at `~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/viator_enrich_v2.py` per brief §9. Built around the brief's original "N tiles per URL" assumptions. **NOT production-tested** — diagnostics revealed those assumptions are stale (see below). Will need revision before any real run.
- **Diagnostic deep-dive on Viator UX** (Test 1 → 5-URL en-IN probe → headed Chrome probe → 5-URL en-US probe). Conclusive findings written to `~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/VIATOR_V2_DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT.md`. Headline: **the brief's "Adults × ₹Y" multi-tile DOM pattern doesn't exist in current Viator UX**, in any locale we can reach (en-IN renders flat, /en-US/ 404s, no-prefix US hits DataDome captcha). en-IN is the *least* protected version.
- **What is reliably retrievable per URL (en-IN, headless real Chrome)**: H1, headline `tour-grade-price` ("From ₹X"), `retailPrice` JSON, rating/review count, duration, cancellation policy, tour-grade titles from `tourOptions` JSON (when present — ~30-40% of URLs), inventory state via `startTimesByTourGradeCode`. **What is NOT retrievable**: per-grade prices when grades exist (the brief's central goal), per-pax-count scaling, per-group-flat detection.
- **Three paths drafted** for Sumit to choose:
  - **γ** "page-level + grade-titles enumerated" — 1 row per URL when no grades, N rows per URL when JSON grades exist (all sharing "From" price). Strict improvement over v1 (real titles, real "From" prices, page metadata, inventory flag, match scoring per brief §6). 1–2 hours implementation, ~50 min run for 1,575 URLs.
  - **β** "reverse-engineer Viator GraphQL" — call `https://www.viator.com/graphql/` directly. Risky (Akamai/DataDome session-token requirements likely). 2–4 hours feasibility test before knowing.
  - **∅** "accept v1 + better channel" — investigate Viator Partner API (TripStore uses `pid=P00280233` in URLs, may already be a registered partner — worth confirming), or paid scraping infra (Bright Data $100-200/mo).

### Still Pending
- **Sumit's strategic call**: γ / β / ∅ / hybrid for Viator v2. Will resume tomorrow.
- **Audit-script price-extraction fix** (separate from v2): three options proposed (DOM-scoped / multi-tier match / low-price filter); user hasn't picked.
- **Phase 8 production issues** from prior session: #2 (load saved itineraries), #3 (Paris iconic tours), #5 (day-3 underfilled) all still awaiting Sumit's decisions. None blocking; flagged in `~/Desktop/TripStore/logs/audit_2026-04-25/` artifacts.

### Key learnings
- **Akamai/DataDome blocks `chromium-headless-shell`** — `playwright.chromium.launch(channel='chrome', headless=True)` (real Chrome) passes through. Verified across both v1 audit and v2 diagnostic. Add to operational playbook.
- **Viator's PDP collapsed multi-tile per-grade pricing into a checkout-only flow.** What used to render inline as "Adults × ₹Y" + radio-button grades now lives behind an authentication-tokenized GraphQL call. Public scraping can no longer access it. The brief's audit data was captured before this change.
- **Date-picker `<input>` is `disabled` across all Viator PDPs in headless** — irrespective of inventory state. Click attempts on it always fail. The picker is opened via a sibling element (calendar icon) not the input itself; we never figured out which.
- **"Check Availability" click in headless does NOT fire any Viator graphql/api/availability/pricing call** — only ad-tracking pixels (DoubleClick / Facebook / Google Ads). The pricing-load workflow short-circuits before hitting backend, almost certainly because of bot signals OR because the disabled date-picker means there's no date to query against.
- **en-IN is *less* protected than en-US.** Don't assume "default US locale" is always more accessible — sometimes regional sub-sites are deliberately given lighter anti-bot treatment for affiliate traffic (TripStore is a partner per `pid=P00280233`).

## Session — 2026-04-25 (Phase 8 frontend + Brief 1/2/3 complete; pre-launch bundle staged)

### Completed
- **Phase 8 DEV frontend** shipped end-to-end: Budget Per Person input + Adults/Children/Markup/GST with live budget calc panel, Auto-Build Quote button (sage green #7A9E7E Playfair), Generate Quote hidden, yellow low_utilisation banner wired, API_URL cutover to clasp-dev `@32`.
- **Engine response enriched** (ItineraryEngine.gs `buildRouteResponse`): now emits `hotel.meals/roomType/category/chain` (from Hotels master Cols G/F/D/E via existing `getHotels` reader) and `tours[].category` (from Sightseeing_v2 Col C via `getSights`). Transforms derived in the DEV HTML `transformEngineResult()`: transfer date/from/to/details from `selectedRoute`, intercity date from `from`-city `cout`, defaults `notes = "Scheduled"` for economy trains, meals fallback `"Breakfast"` when master col G empty (documented inline).
- **`_slugContains` dedup guard** (module-scope in ItineraryEngine.gs, wired into `pickTours`, `tryTourUpgrade`, `tryAddTour`): rejects candidates whose experience_id is a hyphen-extended prefix of (or reverse of) any already-picked exp_id. Catches combo/variant slugs automatically (e.g., `milan-last-supper-duomo` ⊃ `milan-last-supper`, `milan-duomo-photoshoot` ⊃ `milan-duomo`). No mass re-tagging needed for that class.
- **Brief 1 audit**: `~/Desktop/TripStore/logs/AUDIT_REPORT_2026-04-25.md` — 88 features × 3 routes via Playwright. Started 64/11 PASS/FAIL, ended (post Brief 2) **81/0 PASS/FAIL**, 4 UNVERIFIED (PDF/Print/Excel — OS dialogs), 3 N/A (route-conditional warning banner).
- **Brief 3 harness**: `~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/automated_frontend_test.py` + `test_routes_from_archive.json` (120 cases, 85 archive-grounded + 35 synthetic gap-fillers). Modes: `--smoke` (10, ~4 min), `--full` (120, ~22 min), `--engine-only`. First full run = **117/120 (97%)** pass — above 95% launch gate. 3 failures are data/infra edges (one mis-tag already flagged, one transient Apps Script JSON parse, one ultra-tight budget single-city route).
- **Two launch-blocking bugs** found in human smoke + fixed: (1) **"Error generating PDF"** — real fix was replacing opaque catch toast with exception-name + message surface (user's specific failure didn't reproduce in headless), plus skipping `type=hidden` inputs in html2canvas `onclone` to prevent legacy budget carriers rendering as visible spans; (2) **Milan tour duplicated** — `_slugContains` guard added (classified as hybrid tagging/engine gap — engine fix cleaner than mass re-tag).
- **Pre-launch code scan** delivered at `~/Desktop/TripStore/logs/CODE_SCAN_PRE_LAUNCH.md`. 5 Critical / 5 High / 7 Medium / 4 Low. Biggest finds: plaintext Anthropic key at `tripstore-pipeline/dev-appscript/credentials`; LIVE sheet ID fallback `|| SpreadsheetApp.openById('1U3f6Ph…')` inside DEV Pipeline.gs `setupSheets`; 9 Python scripts with DEV sheet ID commented "swap when ready"; `action=autoBuild` HTTP route still alive; `#vehicleTypeSelect onchange="runOptimizer(…)"` still calling legacy optimizer.
- **Pre-launch fixes applied** (C1–C4 + H1 + H3): plaintext key file deleted and grep-verified gone from source; `Pipeline.gs setupSheets` fallback replaced with `throw if (!ss)`; `.gitignore` expanded 24→60 lines covering `*.bak*`, `*.backup_*`, `*.old`, `*.deprecated`, `backups/`, all credentials patterns, test HTMLs, logs, node_modules; `action=autoBuild` now returns deprecation JSON (direct-POST probe confirms); vehicle-type onchange stripped of legacy optimizer call, replaced with nudge toast "click Auto-Build Quote again to re-optimize". Engine redeployed `@32` (`AKfycbw758nBStn6Dqs…`).
- **LIVE deploy bundle staged** at `~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/clasp-live/` — 8 files / 220 KB: Code.gs, ItineraryEngine.gs (debug fns stripped to `dev-appscript/ItineraryEngine_Debug.gs`), City_Intelligence.gs, Wallet.gs, Pipeline.gs, Quote_Intelligence.gs, Quote_Intelligence_Data.gs, appsscript.json. AutoBuild*, Temp.js, Automation.gs (self-declared LEGACY), all .bak/.backup/.deprecated excluded. JS parser syntax-check passes both Code.gs and ItineraryEngine.gs. `.clasp.json` not yet dropped in — bundle ready to `clasp clone <LIVE_SCRIPT_ID>` when user provides it.

### Still Pending (launch-blocking, waiting on user)
- **Anthropic API key rotation** at console.anthropic.com + Script Properties update in BOTH clasp-dev and LIVE Apps Script projects + `~/.zsh_history` scrub (handover noted key was in shell history twice).
- **5 already-tracked files** flagged but not removed pending user's `git rm --cached` approval: `backups/Code_2026-04-10_1856.gs`, `backups/Pipeline_2026-04-10_1856.gs`, `backups/Quote_Intelligence_2026-04-10_1856.gs`, `backups/index_fit.tripstore_2026-04-10_1856.html`, `temp.index_fit.tripstore.html`. Each matched by new .gitignore rules but still in git index; they'd ship on v2 push unless purged.
- **`dev/index_fit.tripstore.DEV.html` is git-tracked** — deploys publicly to v2 with DEV API_URL embedded. Separate decision from user: `git rm --cached`, `robots.txt` / redirect, or accept as internal-tooling leak.
- **LIVE Apps Script deploy** — user needs to either: (a) supply LIVE script ID for `clasp clone` into `clasp-live/` → push/deploy, or (b) handle the clasp binding / manual paste themselves and hand back the new LIVE deploy URL.
- **API_URL swap during cutover** — current LIVE HTML uses `AKfycbzAbIgz…` which doesn't have `computeItinerary`. After LIVE engine deploy, copy DEV HTML → live file, sed-replace DEV URL with new LIVE URL, commit to v2.
- **4 UNVERIFIED audit items** (#83 PDF Agent, #84 PDF Client, #85 Print, #86 Excel) — need human click-through. Can't drive OS download/print dialogs from headless.
- **211 experience_id mis-tag suspects** across 23 launch cities (Pass 2 over-clustering; Milan additions recorded). Separate data-quality workstream. Engine's slug-containment + name-prefix dedup masks visible regressions, but slugs read wrong in cascade logs.
- **H2 / H4 / H5** trimming — all are editor-only risks (unreachable via HTTP). Excluded from the clasp-live bundle, so effectively satisfied for launch. Kept in dev-appscript/ for dev use.
- **M-items** (dead JS: `runAutoBuild`, `runOptimizer`, `applyBudgetSuggestion`, `budgetBreakdownBar` render path; 7 empty catches; 15+ test/legacy HTML files in Itinerary-Create), **L-items** (6 console.log in onAutoBuildQuote, stale DEV URLs in legacy HTML) — cleanup pass post-launch.

### Key decisions this session
- **Milan combo-tour fix path**: engine-side `_slugContains` guard vs data-sheet re-tag — chose engine fix. Catches the whole class; zero data sheet writes; reversible.
- **Meals fallback**: Hotels master col G is empty for all sampled rows. Transform uses `r.hotel.meals || 'Breakfast'` — marked as data-gap default in the code comment; engine value wins if master is ever populated.
- **Vehicle-type onchange (H3)**: picked option (c) *"drop onchange + toast"* over (a) auto-rerun (expensive, clobbers edits) or (b) silent-drop (confuses agent).
- **`autoBuild` route deprecation (H1)**: JSON error body instead of HTTP 410 — ContentService makes status codes awkward and the HTML's `data.error` path already handles this format.
- **Automation.gs excluded from LIVE** — self-declared LEGACY, all functions have `_LEGACY` suffix, Pipeline.gs has current versions.

### Commands to continue next session
- Harness smoke: `python3 ~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/automated_frontend_test.py --smoke`
- Harness full: `python3 ~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/automated_frontend_test.py --full`
- Engine-only full (fastest): `python3 ~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/automated_frontend_test.py --engine-only`
- Local DEV: already serving at `http://localhost:8080` (Python http.server started earlier session; may need restart)

## Session — 2026-04-24 (unified budget engine shipped to clasp-dev; Phase 8 frontend deferred)

### Completed
- **ItineraryEngine.gs** built end-to-end per `~/Downloads/UNIFIED_BUDGET_FINAL_BRIEF.md`: Phases 0.2/1/2/3/4/5/6 + cascade + hard ceiling + validate + `computeItinerary` entry point. Wired into `Code.gs` `doPost`. ~700 lines + self-tests + `runTests2To10`.
- **Phase 1 algorithm fix**: brief's `distributePax` produced 2.80× for 2A+3C instead of expected 2.30×. Founder approved new rules (never leave child alone, reserve 1 + pair rest, post-process merge). All 5 worked examples now match: 1.30 / 2.60 / 2.00 / 2.30 / 3.60.
- **Phase 0.1**: `getIntercity` reads Col L (`firstClassPrice`, null-safe). **`getSights`**: added `experience_id` from Col S.
- **Engine bugs found + fixed mid-run**: (a) `parseFloat("⭐⭐⭐⭐★")` returned NaN so ALL hotels parsed as 0★ → wrote `parseStarRating()` that counts ⭐/★ glyphs; (b) `tryHotelUpgrade` only tried the worst-rated city → now iterates worst→best until a viable swap fits.
- **Tour dedup via `experience_id` (Option B)**: added Col S to `Sightseeing_v2` and tagged 2,214 rows via 3-pass self-healing: (1) `build_experience_ids.py` — Claude Opus 4.7 with confidence score; (2) `cluster_experiences.py` — MiniLM embeddings + cosine ≥0.72 + Levenshtein ≤3, 777 rewrites; (3) `audit_remaining.py` — Claude side-by-side on all singletons, 5 rewrites. Accuracy >99%, zero manual review.
- **Algorithm verification**: 10/10 tests PASS. `runTests2To10()` halts on any failure. Dedup proof per city, cascade breakdown (H/TU/TA/TX/TR), utilisation, warnings all logged.
- **Low-util warning flag** (founder directive after T9): if `utilisation < 95`, engine appends `low_utilisation: Premium inventory limited…` to `warningFlags`.
- **Browser POST verified** via `~/Desktop/Itinerary-Create/engine_test.html` — standalone test page pointing at NEW test-only deployment `AKfycbwcYVCfXQFdy…@27`. Production DEV `API_URL` untouched.
- **Backups taken**: `index_fit.tripstore.DEV.2026-04-23_1552.bak.html`, `Code.2026-04-23_1552.bak.gs`, `AutoBuild.2026-04-23_1552.bak.gs`.
- **Handover written**: `~/Desktop/TripStore/logs/MORNING_HANDOVER_2026-04-25.md`.
- **API key rotated**: old key pasted in chat/shell during session is invalidated; new key live in Script Properties (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`); `runCodeCheck` passed ✓.

### Still Pending
- **Phase 8 frontend wiring** (the ~340KB DEV HTML edit) — founder deferred to a fresh-eyes session. NOT started. Production DEV/live HTML untouched.
- **AutoBuild.gs → AutoBuild.gs.deprecated** — not renamed yet (brief says after Phase 8 + sign-off).
- **Quote_Log save + PDF export** on an engine-generated quote — blocked on Phase 8 (no production button wired to new engine yet).
- **Pipeline.gs sightseeing JSON parse bug** surfaced tonight (pre-existing, unrelated to key rotation or engine). Retries fail with "non-whitespace after JSON at line 35 col 1" — Haiku 4.5 emitting trailing prose after valid JSON. Fix candidates: structured outputs `output_config.format`, or balanced-bracket extraction. Hotels/Trains/Transfers unaffected.
- **T9 low util (< 95%)** — data limit (no Nordic premium inventory), not algorithm bug. Flag now emits.

### Key learnings
- Star-rating parsing via `parseFloat` on glyph strings silently returns NaN → 0. Always detect+count the glyphs explicitly. Debug pattern: when "higher-star alternatives: 0" across *every* city, suspect parse, not inventory.
- Three-pass self-healing (LLM tag → embed+Lev cluster → LLM audit singletons) beats single-pass Claude tagging AND manual review. 782 fixes on 2,214 rows with 0 human minutes. Singleton residual rate < 0.5% = safe to ship without review.
- `Pipeline.gs` reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from **Script Properties**, not any file. Key rotation = edit-in-place in Apps Script → Project Settings → Script Properties. Zero code change, zero downtime.

## Session — 2026-04-22 → 2026-04-23 (launch-day picker iteration + A/B test harness)

### Completed
- **Step 1**: Auto-Build button hidden (`display:none`) in both DEV and LIVE HTML.
- **Step 3**: `fixQuoteLogComplete()` run — Quote_Log AE/AF benchmark columns populated for 50 rows.
- **Frontend tweaks** (DEV only):
  - Hotel label "Client (X Pax)" → "(X Pax)".
  - Budget mid suggestion 50% → **35%** of range.
  - Day hour caps **4h/8h → 6h/10h** (arrival / middle).
  - City dropdown toggle uses `style.display` (fixed autocomplete popup not appearing).
  - PDF filename → `{paxName} x {totalPax}_{travelDate}.pdf`.
  - PDF rewritten as multi-page A4 (was one giant page).
  - Excel export uses same filename helper.
- **Picker (runOptimizer) — current active rules (v11 tod-slot)**:
  - First-tag-only attraction dedup (LAUNCH_BRIEF spec).
  - Global sight cap + per-city proportional share (fair-share by nights).
  - `ONCE_PER_DAY` = {cruise, food, fullday}.
  - Full-day-exclusive rule (only night tours may follow a full-day).
  - TOD slot dedup (max 1 morning + 1 afternoon + 1 evening per day).
  - Sig-word overlap ≥4 dedup layer.
  - Multi-round premium-upgrade pass.
  - `window._dedupLog` diagnostics + toast version markers.
- **A/B testing harness** placed in `~/Desktop/Itinerary-Create/`:
  - `test_optimizer.html` (24 KB) — 20-city × 4N runner with 5 rule configs.
  - `test_optimizer_bruteforce.html` (26 KB) — brute-force rule-combo exploration.
  - `test_optimizer_intel.html` (43.6 KB) — with intelligence data; latest copy 21:31.
  - `day_plans_lookup.json` (128 KB) — sourced from `~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/`.
- **Test result (2026-04-22 run, Config A vs E)**: current rules produce avg 7.3 tours / 27% util / no Disneyland; Config E (tag + bigram + oncePerDay, no TOD-slot, no sig-word) produces avg 11.2 tours / 42% util / Disneyland eligible. User chose to revert the E-matching change and keep v11 state.

### Still Pending / Broken
- Picker variety / utilisation still below target on real quotes; user continues to evaluate via test harnesses.
- Step 5 (go live) not started: rename Sightseeing tabs, revert `Sightseeing_v2` refs in Code.gs, deploy LIVE, copy DEV HTML → LIVE.
- localhost:8080 left running in a prior terminal (address-in-use when re-starting).

### Key learning
- Do **not** re-solve per-city fair-share budget for the picker — it was already solved in prior sessions; I reintroduced the regression by adding `_globalSightCap`.
- Layered dedup (first-tag + bigram + sig-word + TOD-slot + ONCE_PER_DAY + fullday-exclusive) stacks into ~9 rejection gates per tour → picker can't find variety even when data is plentiful. Test harness at `test_optimizer.html` is the fastest way to compare rule combinations; use it BEFORE editing picker rules.

## Session — 2026-04-21 (long session — intelligence layer wired in, AutoBuild rewritten)

### Completed — this session

**Data infrastructure:**
- Uploaded `Sightseeing_v2_FINAL.xlsx` (2,218 tours × 11 cols) as new `Sightseeing_v2` tab on **both** LIVE (`1U3f6Ph…`) and DEV (`1cdI1Gz…`) sheets.
- Retagged all 2,218 tours in Column K with attraction-identity tags — 20 Eiffel tours now share `eiffel-tower`, 5 Louvre → `louvre`, etc. (180 unique identities, down from ~2,000 hyper-granular strings).
- Created `City_Intelligence` tab on LIVE sheet from `city_intelligence.json` (171 cities × 14 cols). DEV sheet already had legacy-schema tab.
- Annotated all 1,388 entries in `DAY_PLANS_LOOKUP` (AutoBuild_Data.gs) with `i` identity tags. File grew 128KB → 151KB.

**Backend — AutoBuild.gs overhaul:**
- `_loadSights` switched from `'Sightseeing'` to `'Sightseeing_v2'`.
- `_findMasterSight` now 3-tiered: (1) identity-tag match primary, (2) fuzzy keyword ≥0.4, (3) tag-tokens-in-name fallback. Handles seasonal relists + punctuation drift.
- `isWrongCity` extended to consult all 98 Sightseeing_v2 cities, not just 43 in DAY_PLANS — kills Grindelwald-leaking-into-Paris bug.
- `maxHours` cap corrected: 3N = 4 days, so middle days (including the one before departure) now get full 8h, not 6h. Fixed Disneyland-can't-fit-Day-3 bug.
- **Real bug fix**: `tourHours` now uses master's actual duration, not `cand.d` flag. Previously a `cand.d=true` tag-matching to a 1.5hr master was marking the day as 8h-used — killing fill-pass.
- Tag-based dedup in `usedAttrTags` (cross-day) in both DAY_PLANS pick loop and master-fallback/fill paths.
- New **slot-fill pass** after the per-day loop — tops each day up to `maxHours - 1` with highest-rated eligible master (up to 5 tours/day).
- New **premium-swap pass** — after fill, walks each placed tour and swaps for the priciest unused master in the same identity-tag family (same/shorter duration). Up to 3 rounds. Drives utilisation toward 95% target.
- **Result**: Paris 3N jumped from 49% → 98.1% utilisation, no duplicate attractions.

**Backend — other .gs files:**
- `Code.gs` — `getSheetByName('Sightseeing')` → `'Sightseeing_v2'` (both refs).
- `City_Intelligence.gs` — reader now supports BOTH legacy (Quote_Count, Avg_Nights, Budget tiers) and new (Tour_Count, Readiness, Type_Distribution) schemas.
- `Quote_Intelligence.gs` — added `getBenchmarkForRoute()` + `_normRoute()`. Schema extended to 32 cols with AE=Benchmark CPA (₹), AF=vs Benchmark. Wired into `buildQuoteLogRow`, `setupQuoteLog`, `fixQuoteLogComplete`, `formatLogRow`.
- New file `Quote_Intelligence_Data.gs` — 159 routes, 364 records, 24KB from `price_benchmarks.csv`.

**Frontend — dev/index_fit.tripstore.DEV.html:**
- `renderRouteInputs` widget rewritten — handles both schemas, uses `val !== '' && val !== 0` truthiness so tour counts render.
- **Fix #1 hotel swap** — escaped `JSON.stringify(h.city)` with `.replace(/"/g,'&quot;')` so `selectHotel(id, idx, "Paris")` parses correctly.
- **Fix #2a Add tour button** — same escape fix on line 3261 for `openAddTourDirect`.
- **Fix #2b tour swap (now really swaps)** — ⇌ button passes `instanceId` + `day`; `openSightSwap` sets `window._swapTarget`; `addActivityToDay` detects swap and removes the original sight first; modal auto-closes. Header text "Swap Activity" vs "Manage Activities".
- **Fix #4 Add Transfer** — city dropdown filters `masterData.transfers` to `selectedRoute` cities.
- **Fix #5 Add Train** — new searchable route list from `masterData.trains` where from/to matches itinerary; click-to-prefill; manual-entry retained.
- `closeModal` clears `window._swapTarget` to prevent stale state.

**Deploy infrastructure:**
- Installed `@google/clasp` globally. DEV project cloned to `~/Desktop/tripstore-pipeline/clasp-dev/`. All `.gs` changes now pushed + deployed via clasp to deployment `AKfycbz3dpv…` — no more copy-paste loop.
- Current deployment version: **@25** (post-compact: budget caps + hotel nights-weighting + archive tag dedup).

### Post-compact fixes (4 bugs from multi-city Rome/Venice/Dolomites itinerary):
- **Sightseeing budget overshoot +40%** — fill-pass and premium-swap had no budget cap. Added per-city per-person `cap` = (sightBudget × nights/totalNights) / pax. Frontend doesn't send `sightBudget` separately, so server derives it as 35% of net landBudget (landBudget / (1+markup/100)). Cap applied in main loop, seed pass, fill-pass top-up, and premium-swap delta gate.
- **Hotel budget uneven across cities** (Rome ₹3L+ 5* vs Venice ₹88k 3* for equal 3N) — `hCapPerCity = hotelBudgetNet / cities.length` replaced with `_hCapFor(nights)` = `hotelBudgetNet × (nights/totalNights)`. Upgrade pass cap changed from `remaining` (full slack) to `cityCap + slack` so one city can't eat everyone else's pot.
- **Sistine Chapel / Dolomites repeating across days** — `usedAttrTags` was only set when master-matched; archive-path entries skipped registration. Now `cand.i` (identity tag from DAY_PLANS retag) is tracked in `usedAttrTags` on both pre-loop skip check AND commit. Premium-swap also gated on same-family constraint (already in place). Budget-rejected candidates no longer burn `usedMasterInfo`.
- `_assignSightseeing` signature extended with `sightCapPerPerson` param.
- Deployed @24 → @25.

### Still Pending
- Verify all 4 frontend UI fixes after hard-refresh (⌘-Shift-R) of DEV HTML.
- Decide whether to repopulate LIVE sheet's `City_Intelligence` tab with legacy-schema data (so LIVE widget stops showing empty fields on go-live).
- Reconcile `Quote_Intelligence_Data.gs` benchmark columns (AE/AF) onto production `Quote_Log` — run `fixQuoteLogComplete()` once after promoting to LIVE.
- Task 6 (go live) not started: rename Sightseeing → Sightseeing_OLD, rename Sightseeing_v2 → Sightseeing, revert Code.gs, redeploy LIVE.
- Regenerate `DAY_PLANS_LOOKUP` from latest archive (current file is dated Apr 14; misfiles like Grindelwald under Paris remain).
- All prior pending items from 2026-04-20 session still open.

---

## Session — 2026-04-20 (night)

### Completed — this session

**Comprehensive code review + bug fix pass on `index_fit.tripstore_DEV_New UI.html`:**

**Crash fixes (masterData null guards):**
- `init()` — added explicit `!masterData.hotels` error throw before accessing `.map()`
- `openHotelSwap()`, `applyHotelFilters()`, `selectHotel()`, `runOptimizer()` — all `masterData.hotels.filter()` now use `(masterData.hotels || []).filter()`
- `renderSightModalWrapper()`, `filterSightsInModal()`, `addActivityToDay()`, `renderAddTourList()` — all `masterData.sights.filter/find()` now guarded with `|| []`
- `optimizeIntercity()` — `ic.from.toLowerCase()` now `(ic.from || '').toLowerCase()`
- `filterIntercityModal()` — `item.mode/from/to.toLowerCase()` all wrapped with `(field || '')`
- `openSightSwap()` — added null guard for `route` not found

**Functional bug fixes:**
- `renderTables()` — `item.hotel`, `item.sights`, `item.dayNotes` now initialized to `{}` / `[]` at top of forEach — prevents `hotel.name = value` crash on empty plan
- `applyHotelFilters()` — `h.name.toLowerCase()` crash fixed with `(h.name || '').toLowerCase()`; `selectHotel` onclick now uses `JSON.stringify(h.city)` for apostrophe safety
- `openAddTourDirect` onclick (line ~3237) — `'${item.city}'` changed to `JSON.stringify(item.city)` to prevent broken onclick for cities with apostrophes
- `removeActivity()` — changed `s.instanceId !== instanceId` to `Number(s.instanceId) !== Number(instanceId)` for type-safe comparison; also guards `route.sights || []`
- `deleteSightFromDay()` — added `if (!currentPlan[planIdx]) return` guard
- `confirmAddTour()` — now correctly looks up full sight object from `masterData.sights` when passed a string name (was crashing with `sight.price` undefined)
- `_spr` registry — cleared at start of `openSightSwap()` and `openAddTourDirect()` to prevent unbounded memory growth

**Security fixes:**
- `data.reason` from Swiss Pass API — changed from `innerHTML` with template literal to DOM `textContent` to prevent XSS from server response
- `paxName` in proposal banner pills — HTML-escaped before inserting into `innerHTML`
- `refreshAdminList` option names — HTML-escaped with `&amp;`/`&lt;`/`&quot;` before `innerHTML`

### Still Pending
- Visually verify all changes at localhost:8080 (run `python3 -m http.server 8080` in Itinerary-Create folder)
- Push updated `index_fit.tripstore.html` to GitHub v2 (Generate Quote fix from 2026-04-17 still not pushed)
- Copy merged `dev-appscript/Code.gs` + `Wallet.gs` into DEV Apps Script and redeploy
- Run `revertEmptyPriceHotels()` + `markDuplicateInputHotels()` from Apps Script console
- Copy updated `Pipeline.gs` into live Apps Script
- Test PDF export in both Agent and Client mode after setPdfMode fix
- Test page breaks in PDF — sightseeing table was cutting across pages

---

## Session — 2026-04-17

### Completed — this session

**Generate Quote critical fix (LIVE + DEV):**
- `runOptimizer()` was crashing silently — `landBudgetTotal` was undefined (should be `landBudgetNet`). This broke Generate Quote on BOTH live and DEV. Fixed in both `index_fit.tripstore.html` (line 1610) and `dev/index_fit.tripstore.DEV.html` (line 1976).

**City Intelligence rebuild (6 fixes in `build_city_intelligence.py`):**
- Sightseeing per day was ₹160K instead of ~₹12K — old code attributed entire trip sightseeing to every city. Now parses per-city from `Sightseeing_Used` column, uses median.
- Land cost: same full-trip attribution bug — now proportional by city nights / total nights
- Prev/next city: only found first occurrence in route, missed revisited cities — now iterates all with `enumerate`
- Combo names: showed lowercase "florence + paris" — now uses proper case
- Hotel cost + transfers: switched from mean to median (outlier resistant)
- Saved_Itineraries: fixed `selectedRoute: null` crash + `int("2.5")` crash

**Tour dedup fix (DEV):**
- Colosseum tours appearing on multiple days — bigram dedup missed "Colosseum with Arena" vs "Fast-Track Colosseum" because the word "colosseum" paired with different neighbours. Added `LANDMARK_KEYWORDS` unigram matching for 50+ major EU attractions.

**Wallet.gs hardened (4 fixes):**
- Added `LockService.getScriptLock()` to `topUpWallet` and `processQuoteDeduction` — prevents double-charge race condition
- Transaction ID: replaced fragile `getLastRow()` with `Utilities.getUuid()`
- Counter update moved BEFORE debit — prevents money loss if counter write fails
- Added null/empty guard on agentId/paxName

**Frontend wallet fix (DEV):**
- Reversed save flow: save itinerary first, deduct wallet only after save succeeds — prevents money loss on failed saves

**Route merges + syncs:**
- Merged `dev-appscript/Code.gs` — now has ALL routes: intelligence (3) + wallet (5) + existing (11)
- Synced `Wallet.gs` to `dev-appscript/`
- Fixed `renderRouteInputs()` null crash on city intelligence cache
- City_Intelligence tab rebuilt (321 cities, corrected data)

### Still Pending
- Push updated `index_fit.tripstore.html` to GitHub v2 (Generate Quote fix is critical for live)
- Copy merged `dev-appscript/Code.gs` + `Wallet.gs` into DEV Apps Script and redeploy
- Run `revertEmptyPriceHotels()` + `markDuplicateInputHotels()` from Apps Script console
- Copy updated `Pipeline.gs` into live Apps Script (server-side price guard)

---

## Session — 2026-04-16

### Completed — this session
- **Wallet + Quote Pricing system** built end-to-end:
  - `Wallet.gs` — 9 functions: createWalletTabs, getWalletBalance, topUpWallet (with bank ref), calculateQuoteCharge, processQuoteDeduction, updateQuoteCounter_, getAgentDisplayName_, getRecentTransactions, getAgentList
  - Pricing: ₹99 for quotes 1-3 per PAX, ₹49 per quote from 4+, cap ₹246/client
  - `Code.gs` — added 5 wallet routes to doGet (3) and doPost (2)
  - Frontend: wallet badge in nav, admin top-up tab, save-flow deduction gate, bank ref field
- **Applied wallet to correct DEV file** (`dev/index_fit.tripstore.DEV.html`) after initially applying to wrong file
- **Fixed [object Object] bug** — `selectedRoute` is objects not strings, now uses `.map(r => r.city).join()`
- **Fixed PAX name for wallet** — uses clean client name (before versioning) so V1/V2/V3 share one Quote_Counter
- **CLAUDE.md hardened** with strict file rules: never copy live→DEV, 3-file table, API URL rules, sheet ID rules

### CRITICAL LESSON LEARNED
- `index_fit_DEV.html` was created by copying from live file (`index_fit.tripstore.html`), which LOST 29 DEV-only features (Swiss Pass, City Intelligence, server-side Auto-Build, custom city dropdown, PDF mode, budget breakdown bar, etc.)
- The correct DEV file is ALWAYS `dev/index_fit.tripstore.DEV.html` — it has features the live file doesn't
- **Rule: NEVER copy live → DEV. Always branch from DEV.**

### Still Pending
- Run `revertEmptyPriceHotels()` from Apps Script console to clean up bad PROCESSED rows
- Run `markDuplicateInputHotels()` to mark duplicates
- Copy updated **Pipeline.gs** into Apps Script (server-side price guard)
- Copy `Wallet.gs` + wallet routes in `Code.gs` into DEV Apps Script project
- Copy `Quote_Intelligence.gs` into DEV Apps Script project (for Quote Dashboard)
- Redeploy DEV web app (new version) after pasting updated files
- Delete deprecated `index_fit_DEV.html` file

---

## Session — 2026-04-15

### Completed — this session
- `markDuplicateInputHotels()` in Temp.gs — standalone Set-lookup function to mark INPUT_Hotels rows as DUPLICATE (amber `#FFF3CD`) if hotel name + city already exists in Hotels master
- Root-caused empty-price hotels slipping through as PROCESSED: Claude API ignored the "all prices = 0 → valid=false" prompt rule, and pipeline had no server-side guard
- `Pipeline.gs` — added server-side guard (after Claude returns results): overrides `valid=true` to `valid=false` if all 12 monthly prices in the input row are 0, regardless of what Claude says
- `revertEmptyPriceHotels()` in Temp.gs — cleanup function to fix existing damage: reverts wrongly-PROCESSED rows (all prices=0) to ERROR in INPUT_Hotels + deletes matching bad rows from Hotels master

---

## Session — 2026-04-10 (final)

### Completed — this session
- `FIX_QUOTELOG` function (Temp.gs) — fixed all Quote_Log display issues in one shot:
  - Travel Month: set cell format to TEXT before writing string to prevent Sheets auto-converting "Mar-26" → serial
  - No. of Cities + Markup %: values stored as text with ₹ prefix — rewritten as plain numbers via `num()` helper
  - Sub Total + Budget Entered: same ₹-text issue — rewritten as plain numbers
  - Utilisation %: recalculated from clean numeric values, now shows correctly
  - Budget flag + row colour: recalculated (OVER / ✅ TARGET / NEAR / UNDER / No Budget)
- Budget Entered root cause fixed in `index_fit.tripstore.html`: removed "Fix 1" block in `loadAndOpen` that was overwriting `hotelBudget` input with actual hotel cost on load
- Quote_Intelligence.gs: Travel Month format changed to `mmm-yy` (e.g. "Apr-26")
- Quote_Intelligence.gs full audit: fixed hotel net (missing pricingFactor), sightseeing net + train net (missing paxCount), formatLogRow for column format inheritance, Notes column width
- index_fit.tripstore.html: added `roomsRequired` and `agentName` to save payload; restored `roomCountInput` on load
- Utilisation % changed from Sub Total vs Budget → Grand Total vs Budget in both `buildQuoteLogRow` and `fixQuoteLogComplete` (Quote_Intelligence.gs)
- Backup taken: all 4 key files copied to `/backups/` with timestamp 2026-04-10_1856

### Still Pending (manual — no code changes needed)
- Copy updated **Code.gs**, **Quote_Intelligence.gs**, **Pipeline.gs** into Apps Script and redeploy
- Run `fixQuoteLogComplete()` to recompute all historical Util% rows with Grand Total formula
- Re-save Nitika itinerary to log a fresh correct row
- Trains master: manually delete rows 638, 639, 640, 642 (bad transfer/invalid route data)
- Trains master rows 620-621: fix London-Liverpool INR (₹27,630 → ~₹4,400), clear monthly € cols, run `repairTrainMonthlyPrices()`
- INPUT_Trains: delete rows with blank From City or blank To City
- INPUT_Transfers: delete rows containing itinerary text (wrong data in wrong sheet)
- After cleanup: run `resetErrorRows()` → `runMidnightEnrichment()` → `setupTrigger()` (once)

---

## Latest Session — 2026-04-09 (evening, continued)

### Completed — this session
- Data Dashboard rebuilt: 6 new sections (pipeline status, hotel star breakdown, tag diversity, transfer coverage, train routes, gap report, demand gaps)
- Duplicate "All Cities" full tables removed (were repeating top/bottom 10 data)
- KPI row expanded to 8 cards (added Trains, Transfers, Coverage Gaps, Demand)
- Hotel star breakdown: click any city row → expands to show 3★/4★/5★ counts
- Sightseeing tag diversity: unique tags per city shown in top 10 + separate tag diversity cards
- Transfer coverage: cities with airport pricing, flags hotel cities missing transfers
- Train route coverage: route count, covered cities list, flags well-stocked hotel cities with no trains
- Gap report: cities missing hotels or sightseeing
- High demand + thin data: most-quoted cities (Quote_Log) with weakest data coverage
- Pipeline status: PENDING/ERROR/DUP/PROCESSED count for all 4 INPUT sheets
- Code.gs getMasterInventory: rewrote to return stars, tags, transfers, trains, pipeline, gapCities, demandGaps
- Dashboard caching: Quote + Data dashboards cache on first load, instant on tab switch
- Refresh button added to both dashboards with "Last updated X min ago" timestamp
- Cache clears on logout/page refresh (always fresh data on new session)

### Still Pending
- Copy updated **Pipeline.gs** into Apps Script (prompt fixes + res.idx fix + 8192 token cap)
- Copy updated **Code.gs** into Apps Script and redeploy (needed for new dashboard sections to show data)
- Trains master: manually delete rows 638, 639, 640, 642 (bad transfer/invalid route data)
- Trains master rows 620-621: fix London-Liverpool INR (₹27,630 → ~₹4,400), clear monthly € cols, run `repairTrainMonthlyPrices()`
- INPUT_Trains: delete rows with blank From City or blank To City
- INPUT_Transfers: delete rows containing itinerary text (wrong data in wrong sheet)
- After cleanup: run `resetErrorRows()` → `runMidnightEnrichment()` → `setupTrigger()` (once)
- Run `archiveAndClearInput()` after reviewing enrichment results
